Due to time constraints, the following objectives have been discarted and/or changed:
- Discarted the objective of implementing a Pause Menu
- Discarted the objective of implementing Collectibles & Lore fragments (except the brief intro and endgame texts)
- Discarted the objective of implementing Challenges
- Discarted the objective of implementing Unlockables

Also, due to the unclear nature of licenses regarding images generated with Artificial Intelligence, the implementation of said resources were discarted. In stead I opted for simplifyng the overall aspect of the game, and rely on pixel-art created by me and using free assets and resources from OpenGameArt.org (https://opengameart.org/).
